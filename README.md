# 🧪 ComBat Harmonization Demo (MATLAB)

This repository provides a simple demonstration of how to use ComBat to harmonize multi-site neuroimaging data in MATLAB. ComBat helps reduce inter-scanner variability while preserving meaningful biological differences — an essential step when combining datasets from multiple imaging sites.

% Harmonizing White Matter Tract-Based FA Values in the PVP Using ComBat 
% ========================================================================

% Suppose you're analyzing fractional anisotropy (FA) values from 
% three key PVP tracts across participants aged 5–21. 
% Your data come from two different datasets: PING and HBN, 
% which used different scanners and acquisition protocols.

% Each participant has:
% 1. Tract profiles (mean FA values across nodes) for the MDLF-ang,
% MFL-spl, pArc, TP-spl. 
% 2. Metadata including age, sex, and scanner/site.

% ================== Using ComBat for Harmonization ==================

% You can use ComBat to remove site-related variability from the FA values 
% while preserving age-related developmental trends. Here's how:

% Since both PING and HBN contain data from multiple sites/scanners, 
% ComBat should use a nested site variable like "siteID" or "scannerID" for 
% harmonization—not just "PING vs HBN." This ensures you're removing scanner effects within each dataset as well as between datasets.

% Your model:
% 1. Input features: Mean FA values from each tract
% 2. Biological covariates: Age, sex, handedness (optional)
% 3. Batch variable: siteID (e.g., HBN_CBIC, PING_UCD, etc.)

% ComBat will adjust the FA values for each tract by:
% 1. Shifting and scaling the data based on scanner-related patterns,
% 2. Pooling information across nodes or tracts to improve estimation,
% 3. Preserving age effects by conditioning on the age variable during adjustment.

% ================== After Using ComBat for Harmonization ==================
% After running ComBat:
% 1. FA values from PING and HBN are now on a comparable scale,
% 2. Age-related increases in FA along the PVP are still present, 
%    but scanner noise is reduced,
% 3. You have increased statistical power to detect developmental 
%    trajectories across all tracts,
% 4. When testing for age × tract interactions or non-linear growth curves 
%    (e.g., exponential fits), your models are no longer biased by dataset.

% Simulate PVP project data for ComBat harmonization
% Assuming 4 tracts (features), 100 subjects, 5 sites

% ================== Code ==================

% Set random seed for reproducibility
rng(123);

n = 100;           % number of subjects
p = 4;             % number of tracts MDLF-ang, MDLF-spl, pArc, TP-spl. 
n_sites = 5;       % number of sites

% Simulate tract FA values with site effects
Y = randn(p, n) + repmat(randn(p, n_sites), 1, n/n_sites); % FA matrix (p x n)

% Simulate covariates
age = 8 + 12*rand(1, n);           % ages between 8 and 20
sex = randi([0, 1], 1, n);         % 0 = female, 1 = male
site = repelem(1:n_sites, n/n_sites);  % site labels

% Design matrix for biological covariates
X = [ones(n, 1), age', sex'];  % intercept + age + sex

% Call ComBat
Y_combat = combat(Y, site, X, 1);

% Plot before vs. after harmonization
figure;
for i = 1:p
    subplot(2,2,i);
    scatter(1:n, Y(i,:), 20, site, 'filled'); hold on;
    scatter(1:n, Y_combat(i,:), 20, site, 'd');
    title(['Tract ', num2str(i)]);
    legend('Raw', 'ComBat');
